%Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop a three-tier web-based applciation using frameworks
	\item Deploy and run a web-based application on an application server.
\end{itemize}


%Literature
\section{Literature Study}
As in previous assignments, the main source were the video lectures on the topic and the example code.

%Literature
\section{Method}
As in previous assignments, the mvc approach has been used again to layer the program.

The choice for a database fell on MySQL because of past works with it.
The implementation was realized in Netbeans in Java 8 EE using Pyara as the application server.

\subsection{Database}
The database in \ref{fig:database} consists of two tables.
The first table acts as a catalog, holding the different currencies, while the second one is the result of a many to many association of the catalog to itself.

\subsection{Client side}
The user can access the application through a browser, which presents him with the jsf (see \ref{fig:ui}).
The user is able to select between 4 currencies to convert between them.
In case he selects the same currency, the application will return, hence show, the same amount as entered.
